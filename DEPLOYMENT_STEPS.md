# Deployment Steps for GitHub Pages

## Quick Test First (Optional)
Before deploying the full app, you can test if GitHub Pages is working correctly:

1. Copy the test-page.html file to your repository root:
   ```
   cp test-page.html index.html
   ```

2. Push this to GitHub:
   ```
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add test page"
   git push
   ```

3. After enabling GitHub Pages (steps below), you should see the test page at:
   https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker/

## Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub
Follow the steps in GITHUB_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md to push your code to GitHub.

## Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Click on "Settings" (tab at the top)
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - This tells GitHub to use the workflow file we created
5. Click "Save"

## Step 3: Wait for Deployment
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow running (or queued)
3. Wait for it to complete (it may take a few minutes)
4. The workflow will show a green checkmark when successful

## Step 4: View Your Deployed App
Once deployment is complete, your app will be available at:
https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker/

**IMPORTANT**: This is different from your repository URL (https://github.com/martingraw/beat-maker), which only shows your code and README.

See URL_EXPLANATION.md for a visual explanation of the difference.

## Troubleshooting
If you don't see your app at the GitHub Pages URL:

1. **Check workflow status**:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Look for any failed workflows (red X)
   - Click on the workflow to see error details

2. **Verify GitHub Pages settings**:
   - In repository Settings > Pages
   - Make sure it shows "Your site is live at https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker/"

3. **Check browser issues**:
   - Try clearing your browser cache
   - Try opening in an incognito/private window
   - Try a different browser

4. **Check for path issues**:
   - Make sure the homepage in package.json is exactly "https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker"
   - No trailing slash, correct capitalization
