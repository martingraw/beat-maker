# Beat Maker GitHub Pages Deployment

## What's Been Set Up

I've set up everything you need to deploy your Beat Maker app to GitHub Pages:

1. **GitHub Pages Configuration**:
   - Added homepage field to package.json: `"homepage": "https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker"`
   - Added gh-pages as a dev dependency
   - Added deploy scripts to package.json

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - This will automatically build and deploy your app when you push to GitHub

3. **Documentation**:
   - DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md - Step-by-step guide for deployment
   - URL_EXPLANATION.md - Explains the difference between GitHub repository and GitHub Pages URLs
   - GITHUB_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Instructions for uploading to GitHub

4. **Test Page**:
   - Created test-page.html to verify GitHub Pages is working

## Why You're Seeing the README Instead of Your App

You're seeing the README file because:

1. You're looking at the GitHub repository URL (github.com/martingraw/beat-maker)
2. Not the GitHub Pages URL (martingraw.github.io/beat-maker)
3. The app needs to be deployed to GitHub Pages first

## Next Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub** following the instructions in GITHUB_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md

2. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings:
   - Settings > Pages > Source > GitHub Actions

3. **Wait for deployment** to complete (check the Actions tab)

4. **View your app** at https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker/

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section in DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md
2. Try the test page first (instructions in DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md)
3. Make sure you're looking at the correct URL (martingraw.github.io/beat-maker)
