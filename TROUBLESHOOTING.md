# Troubleshooting GitHub Pages Deployment

## Problem: Seeing README Instead of App at GitHub Pages URL

If you're seeing the README file at https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker/ instead of your app, try these solutions:

### Solution 1: Use the Test HTML File

1. The `index.html` file I created is a simple test page that will help determine if GitHub Pages is working correctly.

2. Push this file to your repository:
   ```
   cd github-upload
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add test HTML file"
   git push
   ```

3. Wait a few minutes, then visit https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker/
   - If you see the test page, GitHub Pages is working but the React app deployment has an issue
   - If you still see the README, there's a GitHub Pages configuration issue

### Solution 2: Manual Deployment

1. I've created a `deploy.sh` script that will manually deploy your app to GitHub Pages:
   ```
   cd github-upload
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. This script will:
   - Install dependencies if needed
   - Build your app
   - Deploy it to the gh-pages branch

3. Wait a few minutes after the script completes, then check https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker/

### Solution 3: Check GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Make sure:
   - Source is set to "Deploy from a branch" (not GitHub Actions)
   - Branch is set to "gh-pages" (not main)
   - Folder is set to "/ (root)"
5. Click "Save" if you made any changes

### Solution 4: Check for Build Errors

1. Look for any error messages during the build process
2. Common issues include:
   - Missing dependencies
   - JavaScript errors
   - Path issues with assets

### Solution 5: Browser Cache Issues

1. Try opening https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker/ in an incognito/private window
2. Or clear your browser cache and try again
3. Try a different browser entirely

### Solution 6: Wait Longer

1. GitHub Pages deployments can sometimes take 5-10 minutes to propagate
2. Wait a bit longer and try again

### Solution 7: Verify the Repository Name

1. Make sure your repository is exactly named "beat-maker" (case sensitive)
2. The homepage in package.json should match: "https://martingraw.github.io/beat-maker"
